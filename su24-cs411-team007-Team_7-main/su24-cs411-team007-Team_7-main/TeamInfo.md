## Project Summary

A song-wiki that draws data from a CSV to list song details including release year, genre, popularity, artist, and album name. This data will also include values like danceability, energy, and beat per minute. A key feature will be a quiz with questions that will guide a query towards songs the user would be interested in listening to. After seeing the search results the user will be able to click on any artists or songs recommended to them and see further information as stated above.
